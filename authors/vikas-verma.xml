So, if the slug is "the-slug" the page generated would be "the-slug.html" or "the-slug/index.html" (if you have the pretty URLs option enabled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One special case is setting the slug to "index". This means the page generated would be "some_folder/index.html", which means it will be open for the URL that ends in "some_folder" or "some_folder/".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful in some cases, in others may cause conflicts with other pages Nikola generates (like blog indexes) and as a side effect it disables "pretty URLs" for this page. So use with care.&lt;/p&gt;
